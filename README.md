# WiFi Voucher Authentication System

Welcome to the WiFi Voucher Authentication System developed by Tedi Hub, an IT club that brings together tech enthusiasts from different backgrounds to collaborate, learn, and share knowledge.

#About

This authentication system is designed to provide secure and easy access to your WiFi network using voucher-based authentication. With this system, you can generate and manage vouchers that grant access to your network for a specified amount of time.

#How it Works

The authentication system is based on a captive portal, which intercepts all traffic to and from the internet and redirects users to a login page. Users must then enter a voucher code to gain access to the network. Voucher codes can be generated and managed through the system's web interface.
