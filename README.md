# WiFi Voucher Authentication

WiFi voucher authentication is one of the cloud authentication methods offered to school. It allows WiFi clients to have Internet access for a specific period of time using a unique code generated. Each created voucher can be send by sms or email to the customers for use.

Since each WiFi client uses a different code to access the Internet, it provides stronger security and protection than just using a shared password, making it an easy and secure WiFi onboarding method for hotspot management.
